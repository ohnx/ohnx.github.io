        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Mason. I am currently employed as a Linux
            Engineer in New York City, spending most of my daylight hours
            thinking about ways to improve the reliability and performance of
            various computer systems. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring parts
            of the city, cycling, reading, and occasionally coding for personal
            projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I previously studied circuit design and computer architecture in
            college, and although I am less engaged compared to before, I do my
            best to still keep up to date with some of the latest developments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Want to chat about something? Feel free to get in touch using my
            email above!
